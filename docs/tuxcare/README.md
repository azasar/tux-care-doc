TuxCare, which is an expansion of the CloudLinuxâ€™s KernelCare and Extended Lifecycle Support brands, helps organizations take care of support, maintenance, and security for Enterprise Linux systems.

With [TuxCare Live Patching Services](/live-patching-services/), Linux kernels, libraries, databases, virtualizations and IoT devices receive automated security patches applied with zero downtime.

Using the [TuxCare Extended Lifecycle Support](/extended-lifecycle-support/) services, you can migrate to the newest version of Linux at your own pace while maintaining protection from the common risks of running an end-of-life distro.

[Linux Support Services](/linux-support-services/) provide a full range of enterprise-grade Linux support with the perks of a vendor-independent technology partnership: reasonably-priced and flexible services to keep your current version Linux systems continuously updated and secure.
